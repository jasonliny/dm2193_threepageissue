        <p>People have a right to privacy.</p>
        <p>As more and more of our lives revolve around the Internet, it's becoming increasing important to care about privacy both in the sense of
        keeping sensitive data secure but also keeping personal actions private. This includes information we expect to be private such as
        direct messages between two people or login information as well as information we may not be as aware of such as the metadata associated
        with the messages being sent, the exact time and I.P. address associated when logging into a site or system, or even the logging of all of
        one's search and browsing history.</p>
        <p>While this information may not be important to some people, it may be of utter importance for others such as people is situations
        where it may be used against them (e.g. whistleblowers).</p>
        <p>Even in less dangerous circumstances, the collection and use of one's data
        could have negative impacts. As an example, in the case of collecting browsing data, the data may be used to tailor content to a specific
        person. One of the drawbacks of targeted content is that it can create a bubble or feedback loop where a person is frequently served
        the same type of content. This could be especially dangerous when used in a searrch engine since given the same input, two queries
        may return significantly different results with varying degrees of bias and credibility.</p>

      <h1 id="threat-modeling">How to figure out what to do</h1>
        <h2>First Steps: Identify and define a <a href="threat_modeling.html">threat model</a>.</h2>
          <p>In general, it is infeasible to protect every single bit of data from everyone all the time.</p>
          <p>Instead, one should outline what is important to them and continue from there.</p>
        <h2>Next Steps: Assess the tools available</h2>
          <p>With a threat model defined, it is now time to use the threat model to determine your next steps.</p>
          <p>A couple of starting points for software-related tools are available under <a href="resources.html">External Resources</a>.</p>
        <h2>Always: Stay Informed</h2>
          <p>Arguably the most important part of privacy, is staying informed.</p>
          <p>Technology is constantly changing and there is always new information surfacing.</p>
          <p>A trusted company may have been found doing something malicious, a project may have been abandoned,
          a widely used piece of software may have a security vulnerability (that same piece of software may have released an update).</p>
          <p>Conversely, on a more positive note, there may have been a new program released that protects against your threat model. It could be
          more convenient, intuitive, or maybe even more secure than alternatives or what you were previously using.</p>
